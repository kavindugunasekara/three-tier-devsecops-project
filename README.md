# Three-Tier DevSecOps Full-Stack Web Application Deployment on AWS EKS using ArgoCD, Prometheus, Grafana, and Jenkins


Learn how to deploy a complete three-tier DevSecOps project on AWS EKS! This step-by-step guide covers setting up Kubernetes clusters, implementing CI/CD with Jenkins, managing GitOps with ArgoCD, and monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana. Perfect for mastering secure and scalable application deployment.



This Repo is your blueprint for leveraging AWS services like ECR, S3, DynamoDB, and EC2, with Terraform as the backbone for Infrastructure as Code (IaC). From setting up an IAM user with proper permissions to configuring pipelines for building, scanning, and deploying frontend and backend applications, you'll discover how to create a production-grade system designed for scalability and security.

#### Highlights include:

**Pipeline Automation:** Build, scan, and deploy Docker images using Jenkins, Trivy, and SonarQube.
